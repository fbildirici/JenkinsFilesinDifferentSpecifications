This project includes examples of jenkinsfiles with declarative, shared pipelines and groovy,shell,python programming languages.

This section builds on the information covered in Getting started with Pipeline and introduces more useful steps, common patterns, and demonstrates some non-trivial Jenkinsfile examples.

Creating a Jenkinsfile, which is checked into source control, provides a number of immediate benefits:

Code review/iteration on the Pipeline

Audit trail for the Pipeline

Single source of truth for the Pipeline, which can be viewed and edited by multiple members of the project.
